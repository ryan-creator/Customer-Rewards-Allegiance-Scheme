<h1> Project Overview </h1>

The Customer Rewards Allegiance Scheme (CRAS) allows participating vendors to provide tiered
price books for their customers. Customers can become members of CRAS by signing up via
the CRAS web client. If a customer spends a sufficient amount with a participating vendor then
their account will be moved to a higher tier customer group that has access to a price book with
better prices and deals.

CRAS is operated in conjunction with the Vend point of sale system: [Vend](https://vendhq.com)

Sales made with participating vendors via Vend will be collected and correlated with customers
who are also registered members of CRAS.

The INFO303 Vend store is available at: [Vend INFO303](https://info303otago.vendhq.com/)
